      introduction: |
        Shared uploads are files that can be used by all users of your forum. They are not attached to any post, but can be inserted into posts by using the media manager.

        <strong>Warning:</strong> Shared uploads are not protected by any permissions. Anyone with the URL can view them.
      no-files: No shared files have been uploaded yet.

    help_texts:
      disable-download-logging: |
        Disable logging every download made by users of your forum. Keeping it enabled allows you to view the number of downloads and other metrics in the nearby future.
      disable-hotlink-protection: |
        Hotlink protection prevents opening downloads from other sites. Current method requires a csrf token and post id.
      download_templates: |
        Download templates are how uploads are shown on your forum, eg like previews, buttons. Currently available:
      mime_types: |
        Please configure your mapping here. Each mime type regular expression will be handled by a specific upload adapter and download template.
      resize: |
        Choose whether you want to resize your images before they get uploaded. You can choose a maximum width and height, in pixels. The resizing process keeps the aspect ratio of the images.
      client_extension: |
        By default Upload will choose a safe file extension based on the MIME type.
        For some file types based around ZIP or binary data this can result in generic extensions being used instead of the expected one.
        Here you can enter a comma-separated list of file extensions that will be kept verbatim.
      watermark: |
        Choose whether images will have a watermark added during upload. Watermarks are added to non-gifs based on your preferences below.
      s3_compatible_storage: |
        The following settings are only required when using S3 compatible storage. If you use AWS, you can leave them blank.
      s3_acl: |
        The ACL that should be applied to the uploaded object (default: private). For possible values, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl
      custom_s3_url: |
        Use this setting if you are using an S3-compatible service that requires a specific URL format (e.g., Backblaze B2) or if you are experiencing issues with the default URL format. This setting is generally not necessary for most services. Ensure the URL includes the protocol (https://) and is correctly formatted. Example: https://your-bucket.s3.your-region.backblazeb2.com
      s3_instance_profile: |
        Leave key and secret empty to use credentials in instance profile.
      composer_buttons: |
        By default both the media manager button and upload button are visible. You can also choose to display only one button.
