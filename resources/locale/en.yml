            resize: >
                Choose whether you want to resize your images before
                they get uploaded. You can choose a maximum width
                and height, in pixels. The resizing process keeps the
                aspect ratio of the images.
            watermark: >
                Choose whether images will have a watermark added during
                upload. Watermarks are added to non-gifs based on your
                preferences below.
